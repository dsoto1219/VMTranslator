# Project I and Project II for Nand2Tetris Part II

Python code that translates Jack Virtual Machine code into HACK Assembly instructions. Both of these languages come from the Nand2Tetris courses.

There are two relevant files for users: `VMTranslator.py` and `translate.bat`. `VMTranslator.py` is the script that translates VM Code to HACK Assembly; `translate.bat` runs `VMTranslator.py` on all files in a given directory, recursively.
